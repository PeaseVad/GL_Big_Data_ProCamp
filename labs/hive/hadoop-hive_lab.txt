10) CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS flights

>> GLC| It'd be nice to see some execution results here, execution time etc
11) CREATE  TABLE result
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION '/bdpc/hadoop-hive/result/'
AS WITH grouped_flights AS (
SELECT airline, AVG(departure_delay) as avg_departure_delay  FROM flights GROUP BY airline SORT BY avg_departure_delay DESC LIMIT 5)
SELECT airlines.iata_code,airlines.airline,grouped_flights.avg_departure_delay
FROM grouped_flights
JOIN airlines
ON grouped_flights.airline =airlines.iata_code;


12) We can validate  counts in files and counts in our tables, to check that all rows parsed correctly.Difference should be 1 row(our header).
>> GLC| Yeap, but could you think about some general solution: what will you use / need to implement it?

1) wc -l < airlines.csv  and  select count(*) from vpasechnyk.airlines
2)  wc -l < flights.csv  and  select count(*) from vpasechnyk.flights;
